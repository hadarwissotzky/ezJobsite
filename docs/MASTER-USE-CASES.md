# Hilo — Master Use-Case Catalog (consolidated)

*The single source of truth for use cases, merging two sources: (A) the research-seeded catalog I generated on the actor × lifecycle grid, and (B) hadar's CompanyCam-analysis catalog (14 use cases with workflows, dated 2026-07-14). Deduplicated, mapped to the locked core concept, and re-sequenced to the Capture+Evidence-first decision. Supersedes both source catalogs as the baseline the re-derived spec will trace to. Consolidated 2026-07-15.*

## 1. How the two catalogs reconcile

**Your three "jobs" map onto the locked core concept (`CORE-CONCEPT.md`) almost exactly:**

| Your job | Core-concept element | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **Validation [V]** | **Evidence (base layer)** + a confirmation loop | "Getting it mutually acknowledged" — the paper trail *plus* a lightweight agreement. |
| **Change Orders [CO]** | **Change Order** action | The priced, approvable one. |
| **Reports [R]** | **Report** action | Roll-ups, ledgers, updates. |
| *(implicit in V & CO)* | **Approval** action | Runs *through* the others — see the spectrum below. |

**The unifying insight your catalog surfaced — the Approval Spectrum.** "Approval" isn't one thing; it's a spectrum of *getting agreement*, escalating in formality. This is the through-line that connects Validation and Change Orders:

`lightweight confirm ("is this what we agreed?") → acknowledge ("you directed this") → signature (formal decision) → priced approval (change order)`

All four sit on the same mechanism (a record sent to the counterparty's own device via a no-login link — per the locked approval-signature decision), just with escalating weight. That's one component, reused, not four features.

**The one real conflict — sequencing.** Your catalog (2026-07-14) tiers the **Change Order as P1 (build first)**. Our 2026-07-15 decision was **Capture + Evidence first, CO fast-follow**. I've realigned the tiers to the newer decision (§3) — flagging it here because it's the single place the two sources disagree, and it's your call to confirm or overrule.

**Net-new first-class concepts I'm adopting from your catalog** (they weren't explicit in my seed): **Decision-of-record** (the ephemeral "we agreed to the matte finish" that carries *no* price but must not be lost), the **Sub↔GC directive** (protects the sub — this fills the A5/sub-to-GC gap I'd flagged), the **status ledger** (Approved / Pending / Declined + running total), and the **evidence bundle** (before/after + narration + who-directed bound into one dispute artifact).

## 3. The re-sequenced phases (the reconciliation, explicit)

**P1 — The core loop (prove this first):** the capture primitive (CAP-1..7) → **Evidence** as durable paper trail → the **lightweight validation loop** (EVID-1 decision-of-record, EVID-2 sub↔GC directive, APPR-1 confirm). This proves *"capture a decision, make it durable, get it lightly acknowledged"* — the always-on core — without the AI-heavy pricing or the legal weight of a signature. Plus the minimal setup to make it real (SET-2 create job, SET-4 first-run).

**P1.5 — The money + formal-agreement + communication loop (fast-follow):** the **Change Order** (CO-1/2/3/5), the **signature-grade Approval** (APPR-2/3/4), and the **Report/ledger** (REP-1/2/3, EVID-3/4). This is where willingness-to-pay and the differentiator live — it comes right after the core is trusted, not first.

**P2 — Expansion (same spine, later):** habit + compliance use cases (daily/weekly logs, punch list, inspection, safety, RFI), T&M (after alphanumeric capture is hardened), voice retrieval, client gallery.

**Why this order and not CO-first:** leading with Capture+Evidence de-risks the thing *everything* depends on (reliable, never-lost, timeline-synced multimodal capture) with the cheapest possible proof, and the validation loop (decision-of-record) is a differentiator CompanyCam lacks that needs *no* pricing accuracy to demonstrate value. The Change Order carries the money — so it's the very next thing — but building it first would mean betting the whole first slice on the hardest AI (voice→priced extraction, Spanish, number confidence) before we've proven we can even hold a capture reliably. *If you'd rather bet CO-first for the money signal, say so — this is the one open sequencing call.*

## 4. Coverage & the gaps this merge closes / leaves

**Closed by your catalog:** the sub-to-GC actor (EVID-2), the ephemeral no-price decision (EVID-1), the status-ledger view (REP-1), RFI/inspection/safety expansion. 

**Still open (unchanged — these gate the P1.5 handlers, not P1):**
1. **Pricing ownership** — foreman on site vs. office after vs. both (CO-1/CO-2). *Still the #1 unresolved decision; only bites at P1.5.*
2. **Who captures** — field team only, or owner/back-office too (affects CAP-1, REP-3).
3. **Residential vs. sub-to-GC emphasis** — EVID-2 implies you *do* want the sub↔GC world; confirm it's in v1's ICP, not just later.
4. **First integration target** — QuickBooks / Jobber / CompanyCam / none (CO-5, REP-1 export).
5. **Run alongside CompanyCam/Jobber, or replace?** — your own catalog's open flag; shapes positioning + integration depth.

## 5. What I'll do next
On your confirmation of the §3 sequencing (or your override), I'll **re-derive the spec** around: the **Capture core** (multimodal, timeline-synced, offline-first, process-on-reconnect) + the **handler model** (Evidence base → Approval spectrum → Change Order → Report), with P1 = the core loop detailed to buildable requirements and P1.5/P2 as architected seams. This master catalog becomes the requirements baseline the spec traces to, replacing the thin change-order-only framing.
